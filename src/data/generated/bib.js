        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly chatbots with speech-recognition, are gaining attention as tools for ELT. However, this frontline development in contemporary ELT seems to stand in stark contrast to the multilingual effort, another innovative trend, as chatbots\u2019 speech recognition capabilities are primarily attuned to native English speaker pronunciation. Addressing this concern, this study adopted a Global Englishes (GE) perspective and examined students\u2019 attitudes toward English after their use of a speech-recognition chatbot. Text-mining analysis of reflection papers from 38 students and thematic analysis of interviews with seven students revealed that the chatbot hindered the incorporation of diverse English use into ELT and students expressed a conception of English not as a language in flux but rather as a subject with specific content to be mastered. The findings are discussed concerning GE, AI ethics, and computer-assisted language learning, and implications for future chatbot use in ELT are provided.",

        "abstract": "The issue of opacity within data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has become an impediment to these algorithms\u2019 extensive utilization, especially within sensitive domains concerning health, safety, and high profitability, such as chemical engineering (CE). In order to promote reliable AI utilization in CE, this review discusses the concept of transparency within AI utilizations, which is defined based on both explainable AI (XAI) concepts and key features from within the CE field. This review also highlights the requirements of reliable AI from the aspects of causality (i.e., the correlations between the predictions and inputs of an AI), explainability (i.e., the operational rationales of the workflows), and informativeness (i.e., the mechanistic insights of the investigating systems). Related techniques are evaluated together with state-of-the-art applications to highlight the significance of establishing reliable AI applications in CE. Furthermore, a comprehensive transparency analysis case study is provided as an example to enhance understanding. Overall, this work provides a thorough discussion of this subject matter in a way that\u2014for the first time\u2014is particularly geared toward chemical engineers in order to raise awareness of responsible AI utilization. With this vital missing link, AI is anticipated to serve as a novel and powerful tool that can tremendously aid chemical engineers in solving bottleneck challenges in CE.",
